      "To make the coating, try always to grab the same amount of mixture and make a ball with your hands. We pass this by: flour, beaten egg and breadcrumbs.",
      "When passing it through the breadcrumbs we can choose to leave them spherical or, if we press them lightly, we can make the classic cylindrical shape.",
      "Finally, fry them in abundant sunflower oil until a golden color is achieved."
